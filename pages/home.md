Welcome to **SENADA** (Software Engineering and Data Lab) at Universitas Gadjah Mada. We are a dynamic research laboratory in the Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, dedicated to pushing the boundaries of software engineering and data science research.

Led by **Assoc. Prof. Lukman Heryawan, Ph.D.**, our lab brings together faculty and students who are passionate about developing innovative solutions that address real-world challenges in healthcare, education, and society.

## Our Research Focus

Our research spans multiple cutting-edge domains:

**🏥 Medical Informatics** - Developing intelligent systems for healthcare data management and clinical decision support

**🔍 Data Mining & Machine Learning** - Extracting insights from complex datasets using advanced analytical techniques

**🗣️ Natural Language Processing** - Specializing in Indonesian language processing and multilingual text analysis

**🌐 Semantic Web Technologies** - Building knowledge-driven systems for intelligent information retrieval

**⚙️ Software Engineering** - Mining software repositories and developing values-aware software systems

**🔒 Cybersecurity & Privacy Engineering** - Protecting digital systems and user privacy

**🥽 Extended Reality (AR/VR/MR)** - Creating immersive experiences and augmented interaction systems

**📱 Mobile Software Engineering** - Developing next-generation mobile applications and platforms

## Recent Achievements

Our lab has made significant contributions through international collaborations, publishing in top-tier journals, and developing practical solutions for Indonesian communities. Recent highlights include our work on ChatGPT for identifying human values in software systems and the IndoClimate chatbot for climate policy dissemination.

We actively collaborate with institutions worldwide, including Deakin University Australia, and participate in prestigious programs like the KONEKSI grant initiative.
