Welcome to the website of the Software and Data Engineering Research Laboratory.  
Our laboratory focuses on developing and discovering methods and techniques for producing software products that are efficient, maintainable, reliable, secure, and user-acceptable. As both individuals and groups increasingly depend on advanced software systems, our research also emphasizes software reuse, component-based software engineering, distributed software engineering, and aspect-oriented software engineering.  

Another key area of interest is the development of information infrastructure, data management systems, data mining, and text mining. Beyond numerical data, we work with diverse data types such as documents, imagery, sensor data, web documents, and biological data. The lab accommodates and facilitates research conducted by faculty and students who share interests in these topics.  

**Research themes of the Software and Data Engineering Research Laboratory include:**

1. Data mining, opinion mining and analysis, classification.  
2. Modeling for testing, validation, and verification in the software development process.  
3. Software project management and IT governance.  
4. Semantic web and ontologies: retrieving data or documents based on semantic meaning.
