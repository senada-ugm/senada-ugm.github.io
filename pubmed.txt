TI  - Mapping yeast mitotic 5' resection at base resolution reveals the sequence and 
      positional dependence of nucleases in vivo.

AB  - Resection of the 5'-terminated strand at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is the 
      critical regulated step in the transition to homologous recombination. Recent 
      studies have described a multi-step model of DSB resection where endonucleolytic 
      cleavage mediated by Mre11 and Sae2 leads to further degradation mediated by 
      redundant pathways catalyzed by Exo1 and Sgs1/Dna2. These models have not been well 
      tested at mitotic DSBs in vivo because most methods used to monitor resection cannot 
      precisely map early cleavage events. Here we report resection monitoring with 
      high-throughput sequencing using molecular identifiers, allowing exact counting of 
      cleaved 5' ends at base resolution. Mutant strains, including exo1Δ, mre11-H125N and 
      exo1Δ sgs1Δ, revealed a major Mre11-dependent cleavage position 60-70 bp from the 
      DSB end whose exact position depended on local sequence. They further revealed an 
      Exo1-dependent pause point approximately 200 bp from the DSB. Suppressing resection 
      extension in exo1Δ sgs1Δ yeast exposed a footprint of regions where cleavage was 
      restricted within 119 bp of the DSB. These results provide detailed in vivo views of 
      prevailing models of DSB resection and extend them to show the combined influence of 
      sequence specificity and access restrictions on Mre11 and Exo1 nucleases.

TI  - Locus-specific transcription silencing at the FHIT gene suppresses replication 
      stress-induced copy number variant formation and associated replication delay.
PG  - 7507-7524
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkab559 [doi]
AB  - Impaired replication progression leads to de novo copy number variant (CNV) 
      formation at common fragile sites (CFSs). We previously showed that these hotspots 
      for genome instability reside in late-replicating domains associated with large 
      transcribed genes and provided indirect evidence that transcription is a factor in 
      their instability. Here, we compared aphidicolin (APH)-induced CNV and CFS frequency 
      between wild-type and isogenic cells in which FHIT gene transcription was ablated by 
      promoter deletion. Two promoter-deletion cell lines showed reduced or absent CNV 
      formation and CFS expression at FHIT despite continued instability at the NLGN1 
      control locus. APH treatment led to critical replication delays that remained 
      unresolved in G2/M in the body of many, but not all, large transcribed genes, an 
      effect that was reversed at FHIT by the promoter deletion. Altering RNase H1 
      expression did not change CNV induction frequency and DRIP-seq showed a paucity of 
      R-loop formation in the central regions of large genes, suggesting that R-loops are 
      not the primary mediator of the transcription effect. These results demonstrate that 
      large gene transcription is a determining factor in replication stress-induced 
      genomic instability and support models that CNV hotspots mainly result from the 
      transcription-dependent passage of unreplicated DNA into mitosis.

AB  - Pre-mRNA splicing is carried out by the spliceosome and involves splice site 
      recognition, removal of introns, and ligation of exons. Components of the 
      spliceosome have been shown to interact with the elongating RNA polymerase II 
      (RNAPII) which is thought to allow splicing to occur concurrently with 
      transcription. However, little is known about the regulation and efficiency of 
      co-transcriptional splicing in human cells. In this study, we used Bru-seq and 
      BruChase-seq to determine the co-transcriptional splicing efficiencies of 17,000 
      introns expressed across 6 human cell lines. We found that less than half of all 
      introns across these 6 cell lines were co-transcriptionally spliced. Splicing 
      efficiencies for individual introns showed variations across cell lines, suggesting 
      that splicing may be regulated in a cell-type specific manner. Moreover, the 
      splicing efficiency of introns varied within genes. The efficiency of 
      co-transcriptional splicing did not correlate with gene length, intron position, 
      splice site strengths, or the intron/neighboring exons GC content. However, we 
      identified binding signals from multiple RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that correlated 
      with splicing efficiency, including core spliceosomal machinery components-such as 
      SF3B4, U2AF1 and U2AF2 showing higher binding signals in poorly spliced introns. In 
      addition, multiple RBPs, such as BUD13, PUM1 and SND1, showed preferential binding 
      in exons that flank introns with high splicing efficiencies. The nascent RNA 
      splicing patterns presented here across multiple cell types add to our understanding 
      of the complexity in RNA splicing, wherein RNA-binding proteins may play important 
      roles in determining splicing outcomes in a cell type- and intron-specific manner.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key contributors to gene regulatory networks. Because miRNAs 
      are processed from RNA polymerase II transcripts, insight into miRNA regulation 
      requires a comprehensive understanding of the regulation of primary miRNA 
      transcripts. We used Bru-seq nascent RNA sequencing and hidden Markov model 
      segmentation to map primary miRNA transcription units (TUs) across 32 human cell 
      lines, allowing us to describe TUs encompassing 1443 miRNAs from miRBase and 438 
      from MirGeneDB. We identified TUs for 61 miRNAs with an unknown CAGE TSS signal for 
      MirGeneDB miRNAs. Many primary transcripts containing miRNA sequences failed to 
      generate mature miRNAs, suggesting that miRNA biosynthesis is under both 
      transcriptional and post-transcriptional control. In addition to constitutive and 
      cell-type specific TU expression regulated by differential promoter usage, miRNA 
      synthesis can be regulated by transcription past polyadenylation sites 
      (transcriptional read through) and promoter divergent transcription (PROMPTs). We 
      identified 197 miRNA TUs with novel promoters, 97 with transcriptional read-throughs 
      and 3 miRNA TUs that resemble PROMPTs in at least one cell line. The miRNA TU 
      annotation data resource described here reveals a greater complexity in miRNA 
      regulation than previously known and provides a framework for identifying cell-type 
      specific differences in miRNA transcription in cancer and cell transition states.

PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1007/s00294-019-01015-4 [doi]
AB  - DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) must be rejoined properly to prevent the occurrence 
      of serious genomic rearrangements associated with many human diseases. 
      Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a DSB repair mechanism known to protect genomic 
      integrity that is also implicated in creating genomic translocations, inversions, 
      deletions, and insertions. We recently investigated the impact of the pre-damage 
      spatial proximity of DSB-bearing loci on the frequency of trans repair by NHEJ and 
      surprisingly found no correlation between them. In this review, we consider various 
      models that might account for these unexpected results. While DSB movement is 
      necessary to explain our findings, many questions remain about the nature and timing 
      of that motion.

TI  - Frequency of DNA end joining in trans is not determined by the predamage spatial 
      proximity of double-strand breaks in yeast.

AB  - DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are serious genomic insults that can lead to 
      chromosomal rearrangements if repaired incorrectly. To gain insight into the nuclear 
      mechanisms contributing to these rearrangements, we developed an assay in yeast to 
      measure cis (same site) vs. trans (different site) repair for the majority process 
      of precise nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). In the assay, the HO endonuclease gene 
      is placed between two HO cut sites such that HO expression is self-terminated upon 
      induction. We further placed an additional cut site in various genomic loci such 
      that NHEJ in trans led to expression of a LEU2 reporter gene. Consistent with prior 
      reports, cis NHEJ was more efficient than trans NHEJ. However, unlike homologous 
      recombination, where spatial distance between a single DSB and donor locus was 
      previously shown to correlate with repair efficiency, trans NHEJ frequency remained 
      essentially constant regardless of the position of the two DSB loci, even when they 
      were on the same chromosome or when two trans repair events were put in competition. 
      Repair of similar DSBs via single-strand annealing of short terminal direct repeats 
      showed substantially higher repair efficiency and trans repair frequency, but still 
      without a strong correlation of trans repair to genomic position. Our results 
      support a model in which yeast cells mobilize, and perhaps compartmentalize, 
      multiple DSBs in a manner that no longer reflects the predamage position of two 
      broken loci.

TI  - Genome-wide de novo L1 Retrotransposition Connects Endonuclease Activity with 
      Replication.

AB  - L1 retrotransposon-derived sequences comprise approximately 17% of the human genome. 
      Darwinian selective pressures alter L1 genomic distributions during evolution, 
      confounding the ability to determine initial L1 integration preferences. Here, we 
      generated high-confidence datasets of greater than 88,000 engineered L1 insertions 
      in human cell lines that act as proxies for cells that accommodate 
      retrotransposition in vivo. Comparing these insertions to a null model, in which L1 
      endonuclease activity is the sole determinant dictating L1 integration preferences, 
      demonstrated that L1 insertions are not significantly enriched in genes, transcribed 
      regions, or open chromatin. By comparison, we provide compelling evidence that the 
      L1 endonuclease disproportionately cleaves predominant lagging strand DNA 
      replication templates, while lagging strand 3'-hydroxyl groups may prime 
      endonuclease-independent L1 retrotransposition in a Fanconi anemia cell line. Thus, 
      acquisition of an endonuclease domain, in conjunction with the ability to integrate 
      into replicating DNA, allowed L1 to become an autonomous, interspersed 
      retrotransposon.
