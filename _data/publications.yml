# Publications are authored by People, connected by the "authors" fields below and the "publishes_as" fields in _data/people.yml
# Publications are associated with Projects, enumerated in the "projects" fields below
# Publications are associated with Funding sources, enumerated in the "funding" fields below
# Newsfeed posts may report new Publications, connected by the "pmid/id" fields below and the "publication_id" fields in Newsfeed posts
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# pmid is always used as the publication_id if not null, otherwise id is used (and must not be null)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Publications are ordered on the Publications page as follows:
#   descending by year, then by pmid, then alphabetically by title
# thus, newest articles appear first, PubMed articles appear before books or other items
