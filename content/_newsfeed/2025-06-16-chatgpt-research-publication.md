**Yogyakarta, June 16, 2025** â€“ An international research team involving Arif Nurwidyantoro, faculty member from the Software Engineering and Data Lab, Department of Computer Science and Electronics UGM, has successfully published their latest research in the *Behaviour & Information Technology* journal.

The research team consists of members from various countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, Iran, the Netherlands, and Indonesia, demonstrating international collaboration in software engineering and artificial intelligence. The study titled "*Venturing ChatGPT's lens to explore human values in software artifacts: a case study of mobile APIs*" explores the utilization of artificial intelligence, specifically ChatGPT, to identify and explain human values such as privacy, inclusivity, justice, and security contained in mobile Application Programming Interface (API) documentation.

## Key Findings

This research uses ChatGPT to analyze mobile API documentation and uncover the presence of human values embedded within them. Through interactive dialogue between researchers and ChatGPT, the study also highlights the need for expert validation to ensure that AI-generated interpretations are accurate and precise, considering that artificial intelligence models can sometimes produce incorrect or hallucinated information.

The research results show that ChatGPT has potential as a tool for detecting human values in software artifacts, but still requires human involvement in the evaluation and verification process.

## SDGs Impact

This study has direct relevance to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly:
- **SDG 9** (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure)
- **SDG 16** (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) 
- **SDG 17** (Partnerships for the Goals)

By adopting artificial intelligence technology to enhance transparency, justice, and respect for human values in software system development, this research is expected to contribute to building more ethical and humanistic technology.
