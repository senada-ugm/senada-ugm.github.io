## Workshop Program

The morning session began with a seminar on the role of media in climate policy communication. This seminar featured speakers from various stakeholders at provincial and national levels, KONEKSI research team members from Deakin University, and representatives from national online media.

## KONEKSI Grant Program

This series of seminars and discussions is part of the implementation of the KONEKSI Grant sponsored by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), Ministry of PPN/Bappenas, BRIN, and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology since 2023. This grant involves collaboration between lecturers and researchers from Universitas Gadjah Mada and Deakin University, Australia.

## SDGs Alignment

The initiative to develop a chatbot for climate policy dissemination is closely related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly:
- **Goal 13** (Climate Action)
- **Goal 16** (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) - where access to information and inclusive public participation are crucial in supporting governance and community response to environmental issues
- **Goal 9** (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) - emphasizing the importance of technological innovation to support sustainable development

The active participation of UGM faculty in this activity is expected to strengthen collaboration between institutions and countries in developing innovative technology-based solutions to support policy dissemination and increase public awareness of climate change issues, towards achieving SDGs in Indonesia and globally.
