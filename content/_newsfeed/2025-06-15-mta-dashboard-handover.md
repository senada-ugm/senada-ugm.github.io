**YOGYAKARTA, INDONESIA** â€“ Strengthening the implementation of the Tri Dharma of Higher Education, the Software Engineering and Data Lab (RPLD) from the Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Gadjah Mada, once again conducted community service activities.

This time, RPLD Lab delivered an **Attendance Monitoring Dashboard** specifically designed for Majelis Tafsir Al-Qur'an (MTA) in the Gunung Kidul region, with MTA Perwakilan Playen as the pilot project location.

## Project Objectives

This activity aims to provide a strategic tool for MTA administrators to centrally monitor participation and member activity across various regular study groups. This innovation is the result of collaboration between RPLD UGM faculty and students to address the need for more efficient community data management.

## Technical Implementation

### System Architecture
The event opened with knowledge-sharing sessions from faculty members:

- **Edi Winarko, Ph.D.** provided insights into laboratory activities
- **Dr.techn. Khabib Mustofa** emphasized the importance of data for strategic decision-making in organizations

### Dashboard Features
**I Gede Mujiyatna, M.Kom.** outlined the web-based dashboard architecture designed for access from anywhere. He explained that the dashboard is powered by a practical additional feature: a digital attendance system.

*"To collect data, we prepared an attendance feature through digital forms. Officers at each regular study location simply need to open the form on a laptop or tablet, then record member attendance. The process is fast and simple,"* explained Gede. *"Data from all branches in Gunung Kidul is then sent in real-time to the central server for processing."*

### Data Visualization
**Medi, M.Kom.** demonstrated data visualization on the main Monitoring Dashboard, showing how the dashboard can display:

- **Regional Analytics**: Comparison of attendance rates between MTA branches in Gunung Kidul
- **Member Participation Trends**: Over time analysis
- **Activity Identification**: Studies or areas with the highest activity levels

*"So administrators don't just see attendance data, but get a big picture of activity dynamics throughout the region, which is very useful for evaluation and planning,"* added Medi.

## Academic Presentations

The event continued with presentations from:
- **Dr. Arif Nurwidyantoro, Ph.D.** on software development stages
- **Dr.techn. Guntur Budi Herwanto** introducing the komunitech.id platform

## Dashboard Handover

The highlight of the event was the symbolic handover of the dashboard by RPLD Lab Head **Lukman Heryawan, Ph.D.** and **I Gede Mujiyatna, M.Kom.** to MTA Playen representatives as the starting point for implementation in Gunung Kidul. The active involvement of student **Rayhan Firdaus Ardian** in the development was also highlighted.

*"We hope this innovation becomes a valuable tool. The implementation in Playen is the first step, and through komunitech.id, we are ready to support its expansion and answer other technology needs in the future,"* said Lukman Heryawan.

## SDGs Impact

This activity directly supports the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly:
- **SDG 9** (Innovation and Infrastructure)
- **SDG 17** (Partnerships for the Goals)

The dashboard system represents SENADA-UGM's commitment to leveraging technology for community empowerment and organizational efficiency.
