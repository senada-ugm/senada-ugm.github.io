## Project Overview

This research project investigates the application of artificial intelligence, particularly large language models like ChatGPT, to identify and analyze human values embedded within software artifacts. Our focus centers on mobile Application Programming Interface (API) documentation, examining how AI can detect values such as privacy, inclusivity, justice, and security.

## Research Questions

- How effectively can AI models identify human values in software documentation?
- What are the limitations and biases of AI-driven value detection?
- How can expert validation improve AI-generated interpretations?
- What methodologies ensure reliable value identification in software systems?

## Methodology

### AI-Assisted Analysis
Our approach leverages ChatGPT's natural language understanding capabilities to:
- Parse technical documentation for value-laden statements
- Categorize identified values into established frameworks
- Generate explanations for value classifications
- Flag potential ethical concerns in software design

### Human Expert Validation
Recognizing AI limitations, our methodology incorporates:
- Expert review of AI-generated classifications
- Iterative refinement of detection algorithms
- Cross-validation with multiple domain experts
- Bias detection and mitigation strategies

### Case Study: Mobile APIs
We focus on mobile API documentation as our primary case study because:
- Mobile apps handle sensitive personal data
- APIs often embed implicit value assumptions
- Documentation provides rich textual data for analysis
- Mobile platforms impact billions of users globally

## Key Findings

### AI Capabilities
- ChatGPT demonstrates promising ability to identify explicit value statements
- Pattern recognition enables detection of implicit value assumptions
- Context-aware analysis improves accuracy over simple keyword matching
- Multi-turn dialogue enhances understanding of complex value interactions

### Limitations Identified
- AI models can produce hallucinated or incorrect interpretations
- Bias in training data affects value identification accuracy
- Context-dependent meanings challenge consistent classification
- Cultural and regional value differences require careful consideration

### Validation Importance
- Expert review significantly improves classification accuracy
- Human oversight essential for nuanced value interpretations
- Collaborative AI-human approaches outperform purely automated methods
- Domain expertise crucial for context-appropriate value assessment
