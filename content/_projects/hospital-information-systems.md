## Project Overview

The Hospital Information Systems Development project represents a comprehensive initiative to modernize healthcare data management across Indonesian medical institutions. This project focuses on creating integrated platforms that combine electronic health records (EHR), clinical decision support systems, and advanced data analytics to improve patient care quality and operational efficiency.

The system architecture emphasizes interoperability, security, and scalability to meet the diverse needs of healthcare providers ranging from small clinics to large hospital networks. By implementing standardized protocols such as HL7 FHIR and ensuring compliance with Indonesian healthcare regulations, the project aims to create a unified healthcare information ecosystem.
