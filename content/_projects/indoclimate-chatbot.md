## Project Overview

The IndoClimate chatbot is an innovative artificial intelligence system designed to disseminate climate change news and policy information across Indonesia. This project represents a collaborative effort between Universitas Gadjah Mada and Deakin University, Australia, funded through the KONEKSI grant program.

## Research Objectives

- **Automated Content Processing**: Develop NLP algorithms to extract and process climate-related news from Indonesian online media
- **Policy Information Management**: Create a comprehensive database of climate policies across Indonesian regions
- **Intelligent User Interaction**: Implement conversational AI capabilities for user-friendly information access
- **Multilingual Support**: Ensure effective communication in Bahasa Indonesia with regional language considerations

## Technical Approach

The project employs state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques specifically adapted for the Indonesian language context. Key technical components include:

### Language Processing Pipeline
- Indonesian text preprocessing and normalization
- Named entity recognition for climate-related terms
- Sentiment analysis for policy impact assessment
- Topic modeling for content categorization

### Knowledge Management System
- Real-time news aggregation from multiple sources
- Policy database with geographic and temporal indexing
- Fact-checking integration for information accuracy
- User query intent recognition and response generation

## Impact and Applications

### Climate Awareness
Supporting public understanding of climate change issues through accessible information delivery and educational content tailored to Indonesian contexts.

### Policy Transparency
Enhancing government transparency by making climate policies more accessible to citizens across different regions of Indonesia.

### Research Integration
Contributing to climate informatics research by developing Indonesian-language climate communication tools and methodologies.

## Collaboration Framework

This project exemplifies international academic collaboration, involving:
- **Technical Development**: Joint research teams from UGM and Deakin University
- **Funding Support**: KONEKSI grant (Australian DFAT, Ministry PPN/Bappenas, BRIN, Ministry of Education)
- **Community Engagement**: Workshops with stakeholders including BMKG and local government representatives

## Current Status

The chatbot has been successfully developed and presented at the KONEKSI Connect #8 workshop, demonstrating its capabilities to academics, media representatives, and government stakeholders. The system is currently accessible through the KONEKSI project platform.

## Future Directions

- Expansion to cover more Indonesian regions and local languages
- Integration with real-time climate monitoring data
- Development of mobile applications for broader accessibility
- Enhancement of AI capabilities through continuous learning mechanisms
